The Eclipse update site resulting from [the last successful CloudBees build](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/marnix/job/metamath-eclipse-xtext/lastSuccessfulBuild/) can often be found at https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/marnix/job/metamath-eclipse-xtext/ws/last-successful-updatesite/; however, I haven't yet found out where to store it more permanently.
